## Enumeration Members

|  Member | Value | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  Established | <code>&quot;Established&quot;</code> | If Inviter, sent INVITE and received 200 final response and sent ACK. If Invitation, received INVITE and sent 200 final response. |
|  Establishing | <code>&quot;Establishing&quot;</code> | If Inviter, sent INVITE and waiting for a final response. If Invitation, received INVITE and attempting to send 200 final response (but has not sent it yet). |
|  Initial | <code>&quot;Initial&quot;</code> | If Inviter, INVITE not sent yet. If Invitation, received INVITE (but no final response sent yet). |
|  Terminated | <code>&quot;Terminated&quot;</code> | If Inviter, sent INVITE and received non-200 final response (or sent/received BYE after receiving 200). If Invitation, received INVITE and sent non-200 final response (or sent/received BYE after sending 200). |
|  Terminating | <code>&quot;Terminating&quot;</code> | If Inviter, sent INVITE, sent CANCEL and now waiting for 487 final response to ACK (or 200 to ACK &amp; BYE). If Invitation, received INVITE, sent 200 final response and now waiting on ACK and upon receipt will attempt BYE (as the protocol specification requires, before sending a BYE we must receive the ACK - so we are waiting). |
